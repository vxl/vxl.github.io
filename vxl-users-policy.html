 <p>
  If you been referred to this page, in answer to a email you posted on <code>vxl-users</code>,
  then please read the whole page carefully. It should tell you where to find an answer, or
  explain how to rewrite your email so that your question can be usefully answered.</p>

  <p>If you are new to
  VXL and are looking for some basic help on posting to <code>vxl-users</code>, then we
  hope that this answers your questions. Please do ask your
  questions on the<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/vxl-users">
  <code>vxl-users</code> mailing list</a>, taking account of the <code>vxl-users</code> list
  policy below.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h1><code>vxl-users</code> Mailing List Policy</h1>
<dl>

  <dt><code>vxl-users</code> is staffed by volunteers</dt>
  <dd><code>vxl-users</code> is frequented by other users of VXL, including the authors and maintainers of VXL.
  All of these people are volunteers, and none of them are paid to help you solve your problem.
  The advice in this policy is designed to make it easier for those
  with problems to get useful answers from these volunteers.</dd>

  <dt>Please try to solve your problem yourself before posting</dt>
  <dd><p>
          Please avoid asking questions that can trivially be answered by searching the documentation. For example, &quot;How do I warp an image?&quot; can be answered by typing in<tt>warp image</tt> into the <a href="http://www.isbe.man.ac.uk/search_vxl.html">
  VXL documentation search engine</a>.</p>
  <p>
          &quot;How do I use<code>vil_image_view</code>?&quot; can be answered by reading the<a href="http://paine.wiau.man.ac.uk/pub/doc_vxl/books/core/book_7.html">
  vil chapter in the VXL book</a>, and the
  <a href="http://paine.wiau.man.ac.uk/pub/doc_vxl/core/vil/html/classvil__image__view.html">
  class documentation</a>. Please also check the <a href="vxl-users-faq.html"><code>vxl-users</code> FAQ</a>.</p>
  <p>In general, if you can't be bothered to spend time on solving your own problem, we are not likely to
  waste time helping you.</p></dd>

  <dt>Please do not use HTML email</dt>
  <dd>Some members of <code>vxl-users</code> do not use HTML-friendly email readers. Since you are
  asking for their help, please post in raw text, otherwise they may well ignore your email.</dd>

  <dt>Non-member posts are vetted</dt>
  <dd>You do not have to be a member of <code>vxl-users</code> to post to it. However, non-member posts are
  vetted by the list administrators, to screen out SPAM. It may take a few days for such
  email to be posted, and occasionally they may be accidentally rejected. If you want to
  avoid delay, or guarantee you message gets posted, please
  <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/vxl-users">join the list as a
  member</a>.</dd>

  <dt>Please avoid general computing questions</dt>
  <dd><code>vxl-users</code> is aimed at VXL-specific problems. If you have a general computing or
  programming problem, please ask a competent local programmer. We may not take the
  time to answer questions such as
    <blockquote>I have successfully built VXL but when I try to use it within my
       own programs, I get a &quot;<code>include file not found</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>unresolved
       symbol</code>&quot;, etc.
    </blockquote>
  as they can usually be easily fixed by a programmer familiar with your environment.
  If you are a competent programmer, and you think there is a real problem, please do post an email
  with all the relevant information.</dd>

  <dt>Please tell us if your problem is solved</dt>
  <dd>If your problem is solved, please tell the whole list. This avoids anyone working unnecessarily on
  your problem. Please do not post lots of problems in succession, before telling us that your
  earlier ones are fixed. Solving one problem, may make the rest go away. On top of that, the list members
  are human and appreciate the occasional bit of thanks.</dd>

  <dt>How to structure a problem or bug report</dt>
  <dd>Please phrase your questions as precisely as possible. If in doubt, be verbose.
  &quot;I can't compile VXL&mdash;please help&quot; is not going to get a (useful) answer.

  <dl>
  <dt>Always tell us the:</dt>
  <dd><ul>
    <li>The compiler name and version.</li>
    <li>The OS name and version.</li>
    <li>The VXL version number, or date you got it from CVS.</li>
 </ul></dd>

  <dt>If you have a problem while running CMake, tell us:</dt>
  <dd><ul>
  <li>CMake version number.</li>
  <li>Any modifications you made to the default settings.</li>
  <li>The full error&mdash;use cut&amp;paste.</li>
  </ul></dd>

  <dt>If you get a compiler or linker error while building VXL, tell us:</dt>
  <dd><ul>
  <li>The compiler or linker command line issued by make, or MS developer studio.</li>
 <li>The compiler or linker command line issued by make, or MS developer studio.</li>
  <li>The full error and context&mdash;use cut&amp;paste.</li>
  </ul></dd>

<dd><ul>
<li>The test you were running.</li>
<li>Any special compiler options your used (e.g. optimisations).</li>
<li>The full error and context, and all of the test's output leading up to that&mdash;use cut&amp;paste.</li>
</ul></dd>


<dt>If you get a compiler or linker error while trying to use VXL with your own code, tell us:</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>The simplest piece of your code that invokes the error - use cut and paste.</li>
<li>The compiler or linker command line issued by make, or MS developer studio&mdash;use cut&amp;paste.</li>
<li>The full error&mdash;use cut&amp;paste.</li>
</ul></dd>


<dt>If your own program uses VXL, and you have a run-time problem, tell us:</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>The simplest piece of your code that invokes the error.</li>
<li>Instrument your program, outputting any relevant variables to the console&mdash;use cut&amp;paste.</li>
</ul></dd>

<dt>Any other relevant evidence.</dt>
