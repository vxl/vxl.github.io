<h1>Installing the <a href="https://vxl.github.io/"><img alt="VXL" src="../logo1-quant.gif" border="0" width="128" height="48"/></a> 1.14 release</h1>

<hr/>

<h2><a name="unix-build">Configuration</a></h2>

<p>
The most common build system used for VXL is <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>.
You should first download and install CMake. VXL requires CMake version 2.6.3 or higher.
</p>

<p>
Extract the VXL source into the directory <b>vxl-1.14</b>. Create a
separate output directory <b>bin</b> parallel to the source directory:
</p>
<pre>
   .../.../... ---+--- vxl-1.14 ---+--- vxl
                  |                     |
                  |                     +--- vcl
                  |                     ...
                  |
                  +--- bin
</pre>

<p>
Let us call the former <code>$VXLSRC</code> and the latter <code>$VXLBIN</code>.
</p>

<p>
Change current directory to <code>$VXLBIN</code> and run CMake, specifying <code>$VXLSRC</code>
as the source directory.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Unix and Cygwin:</b></dt>
  <dd>Run the Curses based front-end
    <pre>
      ccmake $VXLSRC
    </pre>
    or the command line front-end
    <pre>
      cmake -i $VXLSRC
    </pre>
  </dd>
<dt><b>Windows:</b></dt>
  <dd>Run CMakeSetup and specify the source and binary directories as <code>$VXLSRC</code> and
      <code>$VXLBIN</code>, respectively. In the box on the upper right, choose the build system you use.
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Repeatedly select "Configure" ("C" on Unix) until the entries stop
changing and you get the chance to generate the makefiles ("OK" on
Windows, and "G" on Unix).
<br/>
You may ignore any "something-NOTFOUND" message since these refer to optional components.
But if you are sure that one of these components is present on your system, manually fill in the correct path and re-run configure.
</p>

<p>
In the CMake interface, you can choose which parts of the VXL tree to
build. The default is to build everything except vgui and its
dependents. Building vgui requires the presence of OpenGL and
GLU. Often, these are in a platform specific area of the machine, and
hence cannot be detected by CMake. If you have these on your system,
and wish to build vgui, set BUILD_VGUI to "ON" and make sure the
appropriate entries in the CMake cache are valid. With Windows, the
required libraries (MFC and OpenGL) are shipped with the operating
system, so you should be able to build vgui without any issues.
</p>

<h2>Build</h2>

<p>
Now you can build the libraries.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Unix or Cygwin:</b></dt>
  <dd>Run make
    <pre>
      make
    </pre>
  </dd>
<dt><b>Windows and MSVC:</b></dt>
  <dd>Build VXL by loading the <code>$VXLBIN\vxl.dsw</code> into Developer Studio and
      building the ALL_BUILD target. This project is a little larger than Developer
      Studio can sometimes cope with, so you can do a full build from the command line:
    <pre>
      vcvars32.bat
      msdev vxl.dsw /MAKE "ALL_BUILD - Win32 Debug"
    </pre>
    Or the speedier release version
    <pre>
      msdev vxl.dsw /MAKE "ALL_BUILD - Win32 Release"
    </pre>
  </dd>
<dt><b>Windows and Visual Studio 7 and above:</b></dt>
  <dd>Build VXL by loading the <code>$VXLBIN\vxl.sln</code> into Developer Studio and
      building the ALL_BUILD target.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Test</h2>

<p>
You can run the test suite using the <code>ctest</code> program that came with CMake

<h2>Problems and where to get help</h2>

<p>
Have a look through the <a href="https://vxl.github.io/build-faq.html">Build FAQ</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you think you have found a bug, or if you have an installation or build problem, please submit a bug
report on the <a href="https://github.com/vxl/vxl/issues"> Issues Tracker</a>. Also supply the following information unless you know for certain it is not relevant:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Exactly what you did and exactly what goes wrong. Be verbose. We need to know this in order to help.
     If you have problems configuring VXL, include the options you gave to configure and the output it
     produced. If you have problems compiling VXL, include the command the makefiles issued, as well as
     the entire error message. </li>
<li> Compiler and <i>compiler version number</i>. For gcc, this means we want the output of the
     two shell commands &quot;<code>gcc -v</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>g++ -v</code>&quot;
     (yes, both, please - they have been known to differ). For other
     compilers try <code>-V</code>, <code>-ver</code>, <code>--version</code> or read the manual. </li>
<li> Operating system (e.g. linux/solaris/irix) and architecture (e.g. i386/sparc/mips). </li>
</ul>
