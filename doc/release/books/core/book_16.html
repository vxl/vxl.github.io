<h1 class="appendix"> B. Build Systems </h1>


<p>After building VXL, you will want to write some code which links against
your shiny new libraries.  The details of this process vary depending on how
you are building your own code.  In general, as well as all the system standard libraries, you will need to
tell your compiler and linker the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
For the include directories, you will need to use <code>$VXLSRC/vcl</code>,
<code>$VXLSRC/core</code>, <code>$VXLBIN/vcl</code> and <code>$VXLBIN/core</code>.
If you are using one of the contributed non-core
libraries, e.g. the spatial objects library <code>vsol</code> in
<code>contrib/gel</code>, then you need to add the relevant contrib directory,
e.g. <code>$VXLSRC/contrib/gel</code>.

</li><li>
With the default build options in VXL, all the libraries are placed in
<code>$VXLBIN/lib</code>.

</li><li>
You obviously need to decide which libraries to link against.  As
explained before, VXL is a collection of libraries.  You will almost
certainly have to link against <code>vcl</code>.  You should also link against any
libraries you explicitly use. e.g. if your code has a <code>#include
&lt;vnl/vector.h&gt;</code> then link against <code>vnl</code>.  Any missing libraries can be
added as the linker complains they are missing.  VXL's simple naming scheme
should make it very easy to identify the missing library from the error
message.

</li><li>
You may also need to link against some extra system libraries, e.g. on
Unix, VXL can use libm (for math stuff), libpng, libjpeg, libtiff (for
image loading), libnsl (for Solaris sockets.) On Windows you may need to
link against ws2_32.dll (for sockets stuff.)

</li></ul>

<h2 class="section"> B.1 CMake </h2>

<p>If keeping track of include directories, etc. is too much hassle, or if you
are building a project to run on multiple platforms, then we suggest using
the CMake system to build your project.  CMake automatically communicates the
necessary settings between VXL and your project.  If you are unable to get your
non-CMake Makefile of project file to work properly, then please try CMake -- it
will likely solve your problem for you.
</p>

<p>VXL uses the CMake configuration system to generate Makefiles (for GNU
Make or NMake) and MSVS Project files.  There are other build systems
as well, but most users use CMake.  This section shows by example how
to write <tt>`CMakeLists.txt'</tt> CMake files for VXL.  The intent here
is to show how to write these configuration files and to give detailed
reasons for the various methods used in these files in VXL.  This
section should be used in conjunction with the CMake User's Manual
(<a href="http://www.cmake.org">http://www.cmake.org</a>).
</p>
<p>CMake is available from <a href="http://www.cmake.org">http://www.cmake.org</a> where you'll find
pre-compiled versions and instructions for getting the source code
from an anonymous Subversion (svn) server.  VXL is designed to be configured by the
latest released version of CMake.  At the time of writing, this is
version 2.6.0.  When obtaining CMake via CVS, you can use the tag
<code>LatestRelease</code>.  Cmake documentation can be found at
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Documentation.html">http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Documentation.html</a>.
</p>
<p>You can choose not to build certain portions of the VXL source tree by
setting options in CMake.
</p>
<p>Examples given below are for simple applications and libraries.
Guidelines for the top level VXL <tt>`CMakeLists.txt'</tt> file and
intermediate <tt>`CMakeLists.txt'</tt> files (which include many
<code>SUBDIRS</code> commands) are not given here.
</p>
<p>There are many good examples of <tt>`CMakeLists.txt'</tt> files in the VXL
source, but they are often in a state of flux.  The intention is for
this document to show how the <tt>`CMakeLists.txt'</tt> files should be
constructed and to be verbose about the reasons, and to also be a
style guide for these files.
</p>
<p>It is recommended that the build directory be separate from the source
directory.

<h3 class="subsection"> B.1.1 Example 1: An application that uses VXL libraries </h3>

<p>A single, complete <tt>`CMakeLists.txt'</tt> file follows, for a fictional
application named foobar.  The file is mostly comments, which are
prefixed by '#' in CMake.
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">
# This sample CMakeLists.txt file will configure an application named
# foobar that is built from foo.cxx, bar.cxx and some header files.

# The ADD_EXECUTABLE command configures a new executable.  There may
# be any number of these commands in the file.  The first argument to
# ADD_EXECUTABLE is the name of the executable file (without the
# possible .exe suffix) that you want to generate.  The rest of the
# arguments, up to the closing &quot;)&quot;, are file names, where spaces,
# comments and newlines may be used at will.

# Always give the filename suffix for source files in the
# ADD_EXECUTABLE and ADD_LIBRARY commands.  CMake will try to guess
# the suffix if none is given, but this can cause problems when object
# files, or other files with the same name but different suffix, are
# present in the source directory.

# In addition to the C and C++ source files, all header files are
# included in the ADD_EXECUTABLE command so that they become part of
# the project in MS Visual Studio.  List all header files for this
# application, but not headers from other libraries you are using.
# The reason for this is that users of a GUI build system like MSVS
# will then see every source file in the file list, and can click on
# them to view and possibly edit them.

# Every source file (except for template instantiation files residing
# in Templates subdirectories) should be present in exactly one build
# rule, i.e., in either an ADD_EXECUTABLE or an ADD_LIBRARY rule in
# exactly one CMakeLists.txt file (normally the one in the same
# directory, but sometimes it could be the CMakeLists.txt file of the
# parent directory, cf. core/vil/file_formats).  Template instantiation
# files residing in Templates subdirectories are not included
# specifically in any CMakeLists.txt file, but are included via the
# AUX_SOURCE_DIRECTORY CMake command.  The AUX_SOURCE_DIRECTORY
# command is demonstrated in Example 2, in which a library is built,
# but can also be used for executables.

# If this executable is using libraries other than vcl, then an
# INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES is needed so that include files will be found
# (vcl is automatically included via the top level VXL CMakeLists.txt
# file).  This line is needed to include files from the core vxl and
# gel packages.  Most executables will, of course, need to include the
# core vxl sections.

INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(
  ${VXLCORE_INCLUDE_DIR}
  ${GEL_INCLUDE_DIR}
)

# For INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, the preferred practice is to specify a
# directory exactly one level below ${allvxl_SOURCE_DIR} as an include
# directory, and then the further qualify include files in the source
# code with commands like #include &lt;vsol/vsol_box_2d.h&gt;.  Do not do
# any of the following.

# NO # INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( ${vxl_SOURCE_DIR} )
# NO # INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( ${GEL_INCLUDE_DIR}/vsol )
# NO # INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( ${vxl_SOURCE_DIR}/contrib/gel/vsol )

# Finally, we specify an actual executable. With recent versions of
# CMake (2.x.y), the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, ADD_EXECUTABLE,
# TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES, and so on, are processed in order, so
# INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES should come before the ADD_EXECUTABLE, and
# TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES should come after.

ADD_EXECUTABLE( foobar
  defines.h
  foo.cxx foo.h
  bar.cxx bar.h
)

# Indicate which VXL libraries foobar depends on with the
# TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command.  Include each library that is
# directly used by this application.  Do not include libraries that
# are subsequently used by the libraries that are directly used.
# CMake will automatically handle the tree of dependencies so the link
# command will have all required libraries.

# The libraries can be listed in any order.  However, if you know that
# library &quot;A&quot; depends on library &quot;B&quot;, then it is best to list library
# &quot;A&quot; before library &quot;B&quot;.  Doing so helps to reduce the number of
# duplicate library listings in the link command generated by CMake.

TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES( foobar vnl_algo vul vil vcl )

# Before CMake 1.4, LINK_LIBRARIES commands were used to add
# libraries.  The LINK_LIBRARIES command should no longer be used in
# VXL in ordinary circumstances.

<h3 class="subsection"> B.1.3 Example 3: Building outside of the VXL tree </h3>

<p>It is a good practice to keep your local source code which uses VXL,
but will not become part of VXL, outside of the VXL source tree.
CMake offers support for the configuration of a local build tree that
will use the VXL build tree.  The CMake commands below, used at the
beginning of the top-level <tt>`CMakeLists.txt'</tt> in your local source
code tree will make it easy for your tree to use VXL.
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">
# Your local source tree must have its own project name.  This project
# will be a &quot;client&quot; project of VXL.  It will import configuration
# information and use parts of VXL.

PROJECT( foobar )

# The CMake command FIND_PACKAGE(VXL) attempts to find VXL binary
# installation.  CMake will look in the directory specified by the
# CMake variable VXL_DIR.  Normally, CMake will initially not find
# VXL, will warn you that it could not find VXL, and then give you the
# chance to set the variable VXL_DIR and reconfigure.  VXL_DIR now
# replaces VXL_BINARY_PATH.

FIND_PACKAGE(VXL)

# Whether FIND_PACKAGE(VXL) worked is stored in the variable
# VXL_FOUND.  If VXL was found we then include <tt>`UseVXL.cmake'</tt>
# which will set many variables prefixed with VXL_ that your project
# can use to determine what parts of VXL are present and how to use
# them.  <tt>`UseVXL.cmake'</tt> holds all the necessary definitions that
# CMake needs to use VXL.

IF(VXL_FOUND)
  INCLUDE(${VXL_CMAKE_DIR}/UseVXL.cmake)
ENDIF(VXL_FOUND)

# <tt>`UseVXL.cmake'</tt> will in turn include the file
# <tt>`VXLConfig.cmake'</tt> from the top of the VXL build tree.  You
# should look at this file to see what CMake variables are imported.

# To set VXL_DIR, you could rely on an environment variable:
#   SET( VXL_DIR $ENV{VXLBIN} )
# However, you must then make sure that VXLBIN is set correctly every
# time that cmake is run.  This is often a source of much frustration
# and is not recommended.
#
# Another option is to set the path directly:
#   SET( VXL_DIR /usr/local/vxl-1.0-beta2/bin )
# This has the drawback that the CMakeLists.txt file (this file) has
# to be modified to suit your particular setup, which may cause
# trouble.  If this file is under svn control, for example, you may
# inadvertently commit it with your local setup hard-coded, thus
# playing havoc with other users.

# The rest of this CMakeLists.txt file could contain commands as seen
# in the previous examples, or might just be SUBDIRS commands.

# Remember that all CMake variables defining the VXL configuration
# begin with &quot;VXL_&quot;.  If you want to use VGUI in a client project you
# should use something like this.

<h3 class="subsection"> B.1.6 Historical CMake Include Files </h3>

<p>VXL used to have <tt>`CMakeListsLink.txt'</tt> include files to handle
library dependencies.  The library dependency problem is now dealt
with by CMake (since version 1.4) and the use of
<tt>`CMakeListsLink.txt'</tt> files is deprecated.
</p>
<p>In the past, VXL used <tt>`CMakeListsHeaders.txt'</tt> include files that
were only included for Win32 builds, but this is no longer needed and
is deprecated.  The reason for having a <tt>`CMakeListsHeaders.txt'</tt>
file was that older versions of CMake did not allow .h or .txx files
in a build rule (except with MSVS), but this has been fixed now (CMake
versions 1.2 and later).  It is better to have everything in a single
file, since that makes the whole system more manageable.
</p>
<p>New VXL source code directories for executables and libraries
will need a <tt>`CMakeLists.txt'</tt> file, but not a
<tt>`CMakeListsLink.txt'</tt> and not a <tt>`CMakeListsHeaders.txt'</tt> file.

<p>Your copy of VXL may contain control files for other build systems
such as make or Developer Studio.  Copies of these control files
(e.g. makefiles or .dsp files) do exist in the repository, although
they may not be quite as up to date.  They are tucked away in the

<h2 class="section"> B.3 Frequently Asked Questions </h2>


<dl compact="compact">
<dt> Question 1</dt>
<dd>
<blockquote><p>I have successfully built VXL under MS Visual Studio, and am now
trying to build a simple program that uses the libraries.  The Linker
complains that there are multiple definitions (error <code>LNK2005</code>) of
several things from the C++ Standard Library, or locally defined symbols
being imported (error <code>LNK4049</code>).  What is going wrong?
</p></blockquote>

<p>These kinds of errors often indicate that you are linking against
different C++ run-time libraries with which you compiled VXL (release
vs debug, static vs DLL stdlib, etc).  The flags like <code>/MP</code> and <code>/MD</code>
much match exactly, in VXL's build and your program's build.  These
flags are set in Visual Studio under
Project-&gt;Properties (or Settings under MSVC6.0)-&gt;C/C++-&gt;Code Generation-&gt;Use
run-time library.  You should set your project to (Debug) Multithreaded DLL to match
the default settings for VXL.
</p>
<p>The easiest way to link against VXL, we've found, is to use
CMake for your project too.  CMake will then make sure the flags
match, or else will give you an error or warning.
</p>

</dd>
<dt> Question 2</dt>
<dd>
<blockquote><p>I followed the VXL installation documentation, but found that some of the
entries in the <tt>`CMakeCache.txt'</tt> file say that CMake could not find programs,
paths, etc.  Is this a problem?
</p></blockquote>

<p>No.  VXL needs very little to build correctly (only a C/C++ compiler at worst), however
it can make use of various system provided libraries, rather than build its own
versions.  CMake also looks for lots of system tools so that it can understand
the environment it is in.  So having lots of <code>NOTFOUND</code> entries is quite normal.
There is no need to worry unless CMake displays a warning or error message while
it runs.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> Question 3</dt>
<dd>
<blockquote><p>I used CMake to create a MSVC project with <code>BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY=ON</code>.
But when I try to build, it gives message &quot;cannot open vcl.lib&quot;.  What's wrong?
</p></blockquote>

<p>The CMake &quot;Shared Library&quot; feature doesn't work with MSVC.  You have to use
static libraries.  This is mostly due to MSVC's requirements to have either
a complete list of every exportable identifier or a decoration of every
identifier in the code.  We are too lazy (or appalled at this &quot;feature&quot;)
to try to fix this.  If you absolutely need DLLs you can build your code
using Cygwin, which can produce shared libraries in a &quot;normal&quot; manner.
Alternatively, if you only want to export a small number of classes or
functions, then you can manually list them.  See the MSVC tool documentation
for further details.
