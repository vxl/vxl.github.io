<div class="textblock"><p>This library is essentially just a repository of template definition files, i.e., the actual C++ implementations of several useful (and less useful ;-) image processing algorithms. It houses several IP filters, and it is fairly easy to write a new one, by just starting from an existing one (e.g., <code><a class="el" href="classvipl__threshold.html" title="set pixel to given value if above/below certain threshold.">vipl_threshold</a></code> ).</p>
<p>Every class is templated on five types:</p>
<ul>
<li>The input image (e.g. <code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;</code> , but it could as well be e.g. <code><a class="elRef" doxygen="core_vnl.tag:../../../../core/vnl/html" href="../../../../core/vnl/html/classvnl__matrix.html">vnl_matrix&lt;double&gt;</a></code> or your own array-type class).</li>
<li>The output image (and indeed, it may be different from the input type, so a simple "copy pixels" IP algorithm could be used as an image type converter between any two types of image-like storage!) (This is actually what <code><a class="el" href="classvipl__convert.html" title="convert between arbitrary image types.">vipl_convert</a></code> does.)</li>
<li>The data type of a single pixel of the input image. This has to be specified separately, since the input image type does not necessarily reveal its pixel type; actually, it could support many different pixel types, as is e.g. the case for <code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;</code> .</li>
<li>The data type of a pixel in the output image.</li>
<li>Optionally, the pixel iterator to be used. By default, a normal "left-
   right, top-bottom" iterator is being used: <code><a class="el" href="classvipl__trivial__pixeliter.html" title="This class provides a trivial &quot;iterator&quot; class for use as the default pixel iterator in the new filte...">vipl_trivial_pixeliter</a></code> .</li>
</ul>
<p>The common parent class of all filters is <code><a class="el" href="classvipl__filter.html">vipl_filter</a></code> (through its derived class <code><a class="el" href="classvipl__filter__2d.html">vipl_filter_2d</a></code>). There, all image iteration magic is taken care of. You, as a writer of a new filter, only have to implement the filter on a single "section", which is the part of the image that has been loaded in memory. Often, for relatively small images, this is just the whole image, but <code>vipl</code> allows you to apply any of its filters on a very large image which cannot be loaded in memory at once, without you having to change the implementation.</p>
<p>For the most common case, viz. input and output image are of type <code>vil_image_view&lt;T&gt;</code>, have a look at the <code>vepl</code> library. The old <code>vil1</code> image representation is interfaced in <code>vepl1</code>.</p>
<p>This library was originally designed by Terry Boult for the TargetJr package, and then ported to vxl by Peter Vanroose. </p>
